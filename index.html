        <p>I practice the fine art of software engineering with a passion for design patterns, natural language processing, and 2000's era web design. However, my main interest in computer science (and to a greater extent, life itself) is figuring out how to make things work. As it turns out, a lot of things in this world <i>don't</i> work, so there is always something keeping me busy!</p>
        <p>In the past I've made some apps, participated in (and won) a few hackathons and competitions, composed an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7Llsm8e0e6zcKQDvMasFCm?si=x9fvJiakTKmCezkm-Xt5Dg" target="_blank">album<a>, and traveled the continent in a beat-up van. As of lately, my focus is full speed ahead in becoming the best software engineer I can be. Right now, that means building my career and studying computer science University of Washington.</p>
        <p>Whether you are a prospective recruiter or a secret admirer, you'd like to know more, check out some of my projects below</p>

The idea was brainstormed during the hackathon DubHacks at the University of Washington. With a small team of 4, my friends and I designed, prototyped, and coded the project before presenting it to a rotating panel of judges. We placed as finalists in the competition.</p>

          <p>ClearVote scrapes the web for information on local election candidates and uses sentiment analysis with machine learning to make predictions about their values. This information enables prospective voters to quickly survey prospective candidates that align with their values and make more informed votes at the ballot box. A prototype of the project can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/khHOncKNOxunoqjbRw8GS3/ClearVote?type=design&node-id=5%3A257&mode=design&t=dF7OqxgA3qdW3xTg-1" target="_blank">here</a></p>
          <p>Whether or not this product is marketable is irrelevant to me. Local votes have a high impact on the daily lives of people all over the world. Making it easier for people to make informed voting decisions fosters true democracy, which has the potential to greatly increase <i>everyone's</i> quality of life.</p>
          <p>However, there is still a ton of work to do before an MVP is remotely usable. Please check back later in the Summer! This is a project I've been working on for well over a year now, and it has consistently been deprioritized by work, school, and frankly, a lack of skill. But that's part of what makes this project so exciting. Every month that goes by, I can take whatever I've been learning and apply it. This project requires many disciplines of expertise to pull off, including NLP, web scraping, and scalable, full-stack web development. Knowing that there is always something more to learn to complete this project is what drives me to be the best engineer I can be. </p>

          <p>My friend Elias Belzberg and I were exploring possible use cases of the speech synthesis API Whisper by ElevenLabs. We realized that there are many marketable use cases for translating the audio into content like YouTube videos and decided to enter the Dempsey Startup Competition at the University of Washington.</p>
          <p>In doing so, we were selected to participate in an in-person round of judging from a pool of over 100 contesting teams. We learned a ton about what it takes to create a successful startup. This includes writing an 8-page business plan and meeting with hundreds of prospective investors who had plenty of advice to give about the marketability of the technology, constructive feedback, and entrepreneurship.</p>
